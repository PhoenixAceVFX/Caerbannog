# The Caerbannog Compiler, is the new much more advanced compiler for Flashcord.

It it a Python Program that forever searches for changes in Flashcord's code,

to then recompile it and cause an automatic Quick CSS reload thanks to the accompanying Replugged Plugin.


Uses port 6701 for the communication between the Caebannog Server and Client.


Code is structured and formatted in the same style of SiriusBYT/Kosaka.


Some code is modified from the Trinity Clients and Servers.
